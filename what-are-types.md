I work at HoTT and Dependent Types Group at JetBrains Research. We study particular kind of type systems and their applications in programming languages and pure mathematics. This article is an attempt to explain our field to an interested programmer. I assume our intended reader to have some experience with a low-level programming language like C, a “strongly” typed object-oriented language supporting generics like Java or C#, and having seen some functional programming elements, perhaps in a language like Clojure, Scala or F#. Proficiency in strictly typed purely functional programming languages (like Haskell) or advanced math is _not_ assumed.
