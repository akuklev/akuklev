I work at [HoTT and Dependent Types Group](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/group-for-dependent-types-and-hott) at [JetBrains Research](https://research.jetbrains.org/). We study particular kind of type systems and their applications in programming languages and pure mathematics. This article is an attempt to explain our field to an interested programmer. I assume our intended reader to have some experience with a low-level programming language like C, a “strongly” typed object-oriented language supporting generics like Java or C#, and having seen some functional programming elements, perhaps in a language like Clojure, Scala or F#. Proficiency in strictly typed purely functional programming languages like Haskell or fluency in advanced math is _not_ assumed.

Types are there to classify “range” of variables and parameters in two classes of formal languages: programming languages and mathematical languages used for writing down theorems and proofs. Our groups is works in both directions:
– We develop one of the leading interactive theorem provers called [Arend](https://arend-lang.github.io/) and its respective language.
— We are working on type system embracing complex computational behaviours including concurrency and nondeterminism.

History of type theory is therefore twofold, types were first introduced and studied by logicians and proof theorists, most notably Bertrand Russell between 1902 and 1908 for the family of formal languages for his Principia Mathematica project of codifying basic mathematics, and Kurt Gödel between 1944 and 1958 for his proof of relative consistency of arithmetics. Types were rediscovered by programming language designers in late 1950s, but the type systems used for programming languages were rudimentary: type declarations were used only by compilers to find out what registers/how many memory cells to use for which variables, and which operations are allowed on which variables. You don't need a complex type system for that: under the hood all variables are bit strings of fixed length.
